This is just my personal web site! It's a static website, so Rails is a little overkill... (but I wanted to get familiar with Rails, so that's why I did it).

This is running `Ruby 2.0.0` and `Rails 4.0.0`. To get it running, install all the gems:

```
bundle install --without production
bundle update
bundle install
```

And then run 'rails server'!
