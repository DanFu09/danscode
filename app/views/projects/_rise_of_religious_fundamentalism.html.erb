			Over the past fifty years, religious fundamentalism has been rising in popularity around the world. From religious fundamentalists in the Middle East to Evangelical Christians in the United States, there has been of religious fundamentalism becoming more widespread and more politically active. In this project, I hope to uncover some root causes of this rise in religious fundamentalism and identify key similarities that all religious fundamentalist movements hold in common. This project is still very much in its early, exploratory phases.

			Side note: this project is being done for the Global Scholars program at my school, which is roughly analagous to an International Baccalaureate program. Participants are required to complete a two-year-long research project and to take two years of a philosophy course along with a minimum of five AP courses. The goal of the program is to get students to become more independent and give them the experience of academia.
