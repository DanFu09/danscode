		  <h2>At a Glance</h2>
		  <p>I am currently a freshman at Harvard College, and I recently graduated from Park Tudor School, a high school in Indianapolis. I enjoy doing computer science and math, and I have combined those interests in a few internships and research projects (which you can read about on the <%= link_to "Projects page", projects_path %>). I'm also interested in history and ballroom dancing, and I occasionally make <%= link_to "fractal art", fractal_link%> in my free time.</p>

		  <h2>Computer Science Background</h2>
		  <h3>High School</h3>
		  <p>The first computer science course I took was AP Computer Science at Park Tudor my freshman year. The summer after that, I did a summer CS camp where we learned how to write Android and iOS apps and where we wrote the Android version of the ScoreZone App. My sophomore year, I took Data Structures. The next course in the standard PT CS curriculum was Web Development, but I decided to take Dave Berque's Compilers course instead, which is when I developed the YASL Compiler. Dr. Berque was also the one who first introduced me to DyKnow, where I worked as an intern the summer after my junior year. My senior year of high school, I decided to do an independent study and take Saylor.org's Operating System course, and I did another internship at Interactive Intelligence the summer after my senior year.  I also participated in a number of CS competitions throughout my high school career.</p>
		  <h3>College</h3>
		  <p>My college career has just started, so there's not much to report yet.  I'm currently taking a second-year course on Systems Programming and Machine Organization, and I'm serving on the Harvard International Review's tech board.  We run a <%= link_to "website", "http://hir.harvard.edu"%> that gets upwards of 750,000 views per year.</p>
		  <h3>General Experience</h3>
		  <p>Languages I have experience with include C/C++, Java, JavaScript, Ruby, and Python.  Frameworks I have experience with include AngularJS, Rails, ASP.NET, Node.JS, and Android.</p>
